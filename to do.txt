solution: broadcast to all devices at 192.168.128.255
append 1 at the front for LED drivers, or 0 for SMPS
all picows receive udp packets, they themselves look for if it is relevent to them

need to:
recombine udp test and driver v2 into driver v3
adjust esp32 to add extra digit and send to broadcast address
